# M5Stack-Screen-Capture
If you spend a lot of time developing a nice graphical interface for your application, you want to have nice pictures of it. Taking a picture with your smartphone and then using it on a web page is very old-fashioned. Every PC has a screenshot program that can be used to take screenshots digitally. Now, also for the M5Stack there is this possibility. The times of smartphone pictures are over!
